AI Agent (MCP host)  -->  MCP request  -->  TokenShrinker (MCP server)

                       Agent forwards compressed payload to model backend

Benefits:

Single trusted place to compress repo/long context.

Works for any MCP-capable AI (no per-extension wiring).

Central policies: retention, redaction, model-selection, caching, rate limits.

What your MCP server should expose (capabilities)

Minimal capability to start:

An MCP “tool” endpoint (HTTP) that accepts MCP-style calls (JSON payloads) and returns shrinked content.

Endpoints:

POST /mcp/invoke — generic invoke for tool methods (shrink, summarize, fetch-summary)

GET /.well-known/mcp-tool (or similar) — optional tool manifest describing your tool (name, methods, auth).

Internals:

Use your existing optimizeText() + getRepoSummary() logic.

File-safe summaries, safe cache (we fixed Windows issues).

Config: model selection via env var, rate limits, allowed hosts, logging level.

MCP is JSON-RPC style and many hosts expect JSON-over-HTTP. See MCP spec and examples.

Authentication & Security (very important)

MCP servers can expose sensitive data — plan for:

Mutual TLS or at least HTTPS for transport.

API keys or signed JWTs for each client (AI host) that uses your server. Use x-mcp-api-key header or OAuth flow.

Per-client allowlist: only allow known MCP hosts.

Audit logs and rate limiting to protect your LLM credits.

Data retention & redaction policies: don’t store raw input unless necessary; if you must, encrypt at rest.
Security considerations are a top concern in MCP discussions.

Caching, embedding retrieval & selective context (how to actually reduce tokens)

To minimize tokens effectively, your server should implement multiple strategies:

Per-file summaries (you already do) — disk cache summaries/.

Embeddings + similarity — compute embeddings for files/summaries and at runtime retrieve only top-K relevant chunks. This reduces tokens dramatically.

Delta updates — watcher updates only changed files.

Prompt scaffolding — return a structured compressed context, not raw text (e.g., bullet list of functions changed, top imports, API surface).

Compression/encoding — you can compress text (gzip/base64) if the host supports decompressing it; usually sending a short summary is better than compressed raw text.

Policy-driven pruning — only include items matching classifier (relevance to question, file path, recent edits).

If you want, I can add an embeddings + vector search stub (local FAISS-like or use a vector DB) so your MCP server returns ranked snippets instead of whole summaries.

Integration with AI hosts (how agents call you)

If the host supports MCP natively, it will call your tool using a tool invocation mechanism. Provide your manifest and auth details.

For hosts that don’t support MCP yet, you can offer a proxy endpoint that developer extensions can call (like your earlier local HTTP endpoint).

Document the request/response format in your README and include example cURL and Postman calls.
